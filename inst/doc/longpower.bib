	note={ID: 113328916},
	abstract={Models for the analysis of longitudinal data must recognize the relationship between serial observations on the same unit. Multivariate models with general covariance structure are often difficult to apply to highly unbalanced data, whereas two-stage random-effects models can be used easily. In two-stage models, the probability distributions for the response vectors of different individuals belong to a single family, but some random-effects parameters vary across individuals, with a distribution specified at the second stage. A general family of models is discussed, which includes both growth models and repeated-measures models as special cases. A unified approach to fitting these models, based on a combination of empirical Bayes and maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and using the EM algorithm, is discussed. Two examples are taken from a current epidemiological study of the health effects of air pollution.},

	note={ID: 119956120},
	abstract={Correlated data occur frequently in biomedical research. Examples include longitudinal studies, family studies, and ophthalmologic studies. In this paper, we present a method to compute sample sizes and statistical powers for studies involving correlated observations. This is a multivariate extension of the work by Self and Mauritsen (1988, Biometrics 44, 79-86), who derived a sample size and power formula for generalized linear models based on the score statistic. For correlated data, we appeal to a statistic based on the generalized estimating equation method (Liang and Zeger, 1986, Biometrika 73, 13-22). We highlight the additional assumptions needed to deal with correlated data. Some special cases that are commonly seen in practice are discussed, followed by simulation studies.},

	title={Longitudinal data analysis for discrete and continuous outcomes.},
	journal={Biometrics},
	volume={42},
	number={1},
	pages={121-30},
	note={ID: 115936579},
	abstract={Longitudinal data sets are comprised of repeated observations of an outcome and a set of covariates for each of many subjects. One objective of statistical analysis is to describe the marginal expectation of the outcome variable as a function of the covariates while accounting for the correlation among the repeated observations for a given subject. This paper proposes a unifying approach to such analysis for a variety of discrete and continuous outcomes. A class of generalized estimating equations (GEEs) for the regression parameters is proposed. The equations are extensions of those used in quasi-likelihood (Wedderburn, 1974, Biometrika 61, 439-447) methods. The GEEs have solutions which are consistent and asymptotically Gaussian even when the time dependence is misspecified as we often expect. A consistent variance estimate is presented. We illustrate the use of the GEE approach with longitudinal data from a study of the effect of mothers' stress on children's morbidity.},
